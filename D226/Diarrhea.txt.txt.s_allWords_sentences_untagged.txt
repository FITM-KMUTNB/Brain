diarrhea mean increase active secretion inhibition absorption
little structural damage
common cause type diarrhea cholera toxin stimulate secretion anion especially chloride ion
therefore maintain charge balance gastrointestinal tract sodium carry water
type diarrhea intestinal fluid secretion isotonic plasma even fast continue even oral food intake
diarrhea occur water drawn bowel
person drink solution excessive sugar excessive salt draw water body bowel cause osmotic diarrhea diarrhea result eg pancreatic disease coeliac disease nutrient left lumen pull water
cause osmotic laxative work alleviate constipation draw water bowel
healthy individual magnesium vitamin c undigest lactose produce osmotic diarrhea distention bowel
person lactose intolerance difficulty absorb lactose extraordinarily high intake dairy product
person fructose malabsorption excess fructose intake cause diarrhea
food high glucose content absorbable likely cause diarrhea
sugar alcohol found sugar-free food difficult body absorb large amount lead osmotic diarrhea case osmotic diarrhea stop offend agent eg milk sorbitol stop
