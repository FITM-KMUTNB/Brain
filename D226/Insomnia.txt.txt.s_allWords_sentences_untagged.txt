prevention treatment insomnia require combination cognitive behavioral therapy medication lifestyle change
lifestyle practice go sleep wake time day create steady pattern help prevent insomnia avoidance vigorous exercise caffeinate drink hour go sleep recommend exercise earlier day beneficial practice improve sleep hygiene include
avoid limit nap treate pain bedtime avoid large meal beverage alcohol nicotine bedtime find sooth way relax sleep use white noise make bedroom suitable sleep keep dark cool free device clock cell phone television sleep positive attitude maintain regular exercise try relax activity sleep use bed sleep sex stop check time

use mainly reduce symptom insomnia short duration role management chronic insomnia remain unclear different type medication use doctor recommend rely prescription sleep pill long-term use important identify treat medical condition contribute insomnia depression breath problem chronic pain people insomnia remain insufficiently treate non-medication base
base strategy comparable efficacy hypnotic medication insomnia longer last effect
medication recommend short-term use dependence rebound withdrawal effect discontinuation tolerance develop
medication base strategy provide long last improvement insomnia recommend line long-term strategy management
strategy include attention sleep hygiene stimulus control intervention therapy paradoxical intention patient education relaxation therapy example keep journal restrict time spent awake bed practice relaxation technique maintain regular sleep schedule wake-up time therapy assist patient develop new sleep improve sleep quality consolidation
therapy include learn healthy sleep habit promote sleep relaxation undergo light therapy help strategy regulate circadian clock
music improve insomnia adult eeg biofeedback demonstrate effectiveness treatment insomnia improvement duration well quality sleep self-help therapy define psychological therapy work improve sleep quality adult insomnia small moderate degree
control therapy treatment patient condition associate bed sleep general negative response
stimulus control therapy involve take step control sleep environment sometime refer interchangeably concept sleep hygiene
example environmental modification include use bed sleep sex activity read watch television wake time morn weekend go bed sleepy high likelihood sleep occur leave bed begine activity location sleep result reasonably brief period time get bed commonly min reduce subjective effort energy expend try fall asleep avoid exposure bright light nighttime hour eliminate daytime nap
component stimulus control therapy sleep restriction technique aim match time spent bed actual time spent asleep
technique involve maintain strict sleep-wake schedule sleep certain time day specific amount time induce mild sleep deprivation
complete treatment usually last week involve make sleep minimum amount time actually capable average capable ie sleep efficiency improve slowly increase amount min go bed earlier body attempt reset internal sleep clock
bright light therapy use help early morn reset natural sleep cycle use sleep restriction therapy reinforce new wake schedule
apply technique consistency difficult positive effect insomnia motivate patient
intention cognitive refram technique insomnia instead attempt fall asleep night make effort stay awake ie essentially stop try fall asleep
theory explain effectiveness method voluntarily make go sleep relieve performance anxiety arise need requirement fall asleep meant passive act
technique show reduce sleep effort performance anxiety lower subjective assessment latency overestimation sleep deficit quality found insomnia sleep hygiene
sleep hygiene common term behavior relate promotion good sleep
behavior use basis sleep intervention primary focus sleep education program include reduce caffeine nicotine alcohol consumption maximize regularity efficiency sleep episode minimize medication usage daytime nap promotion regular exercise facilitation positive sleep environment exercise helpful establish routine sleep close time plan go sleep
