sign symptom
common symptom pancreatitis severe upper abdominal left upper quadrant burn pain radiate back nausea vomit worse eate
physical examination vary severity presence internal bleed
blood pressure elevate pain decrease dehydration bleed
heart respiratory rate elevate
abdomen usually tender lesser degree pain
common abdominal disease bowel sound reduce reflex bowel paralysis
fever jaundice present
chronic pancreatitis lead diabete pancreatic cancer
weight loss occur lack pancreatic enzyme hinder digestion
early complication include shock infection systemic inflammatory response syndrome low blood calcium high blood glucose dehydration
blood loss dehydration fluid leak abdominal cavity ascite lead kidney failure
respiratory complication severe
effusion usually present
shallow breath pain lead lung collapse
pancreatic enzyme attack lung cause inflammation
severe inflammation lead intra-abdominal hypertension abdominal compartment syndrome further impair renal respiratory function potentially require management open abdomen relieve pressure
late complication include recurrent pancreatitis development pancreatic pseudocystscollection pancreatic secretion wall scar tissue
