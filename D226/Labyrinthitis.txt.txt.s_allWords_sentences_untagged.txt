vestibular system set sensory input consist semicircular canal sense change rotational motion otolith sense change linear motion
brain combine visual cue sensory input vestibular system determine adjustment require retain balance
vestibular system relay information head movement eye muscle form vestibuloocular reflex retain continuous visual focus motion
treatment labyrinthitis depend cause
symptom vertigo treate way vestibular rehabilitation physical therapy
typical treatment include combination head eye movement postural change walk exercise
specifically exercise prescribe include keep eye fixate specific target move head move head right left target significant distance walk keep eye fixate specific target walk keep eye fixate specific target turn head different direction main function repeate combination head eye movement postural change walk repetition compensatory change dysfunction arise peripheral vestibular structure promote central vestibular system brainstem cerebellum
rehabilitation therapy highly effective way substantially reduce eliminate residual dizziness labyrinthitis vrt work cause brain use exist neural mechanism adaptation compensation
rehabilitation strategy commonly use
gaze stability exercise move head side side fixate stationary object aim assist eye fixate head rotation input lost canal reflex
advance progression exercise walk straight line look side side turn head
exercise movement design provoke symptom subsequently reduce negative vestibular response repetition
example include brandtdaroff exercise

labyrinthitis generally self-limit disease
treatment drug neither necessary possible
effect glucocorticoid study found significantly affect long-term outcome
treatment use suppress symptom labyrinthitis spontaneously commonly prescribe medication help alleviate symptom vertigo nausea
study show older adult dementia take medication mental illness increase chance death treatment
mood disorder interfere vestibular compensation adaptive plasticity suggest address co-occure anxiety disorder depression
severe anxiety episode usually address short-term benzodiazapine therapy
long-term use diazepam recommend due tolerance issue number line treatment anxiety depression
case condition tend self-limit
greater labyrinthitis one-time experience people fully recover
recovery acute labyrinthine inflammation generally take week uncommon residual symptom dizziness last couple month
recovery temporary damage inner ear typically follow phase
acute period include severe vertigo vomit approximately week sub-acute symptom rapid recovery
