initial therapy
removal microbial plaque calculus necessary establish periodontal health
step treatment periodontal disease involve clean gumline procedure call root surface instrumentation rsy cause mechanical disturbance bacterial biofilm gumline procedure involve use specialize curette mechanically remove plaque calculus gumline require multiple visit local anesthesia adequately complete
addition initial root surface instrumentation necessary adjust occlusion bite prevent excessive force teeth reduce bone support
necessary complete dental need replacement rough plaque-retentive restoration closure open contact teeth requirement diagnose initial evaluation
important note rsi different scale root plane rsy remove calculus scale root plane remove calculus well underly soften dentine leave smooth glassy surface requiste periodontal heal
therefore rsi advocate root plane
scale root plane usually successful periodontal pocket shallower mm dentist hygienist perform re-evaluation week initial scale root plane determine person oral hygiene improve inflammation regress
avoid analysis index determine presence absence inflammation
monthly reevaluation periodontal therapy involve periodontal chart better indication success treatment see course treatment identify
pocket depth greater mm remain initial therapy bleed probe indicate continue active disease likely lead further bone loss time
especially true molar tooth site furcation area root expose
therapy found unsuccessful manage sign disease activity periodontal surgery need stop progressive bone loss regenerate lost bone possible
surgical approache use treatment advance periodontal disease open flap surgery well guide tissue regeneration bone graft
goal periodontal surgery access definitive calculus removal surgical management bony irregularity result disease process reduce pocket possible
long-term study show moderate advance periodontal disease surgically treate case further breakdown time couple regular post-treatment maintenance regimen successful nearly halt tooth loss nearly diagnose people local drug delivery

involve regular detail month prevent periodontal disease -cause microorganism closely monitor affect teeth early treatment render disease recur
usually periodontal disease exist due poor plaque control therefore brush technique modify periodontal recurrence probable
alternative periodontal disease treatment involve inject antimicrobial solution hydrogen peroxide periodontal pocket slender applicator oral irrigator

dentist dental hygienist measure periodontal disease use device call periodontal probe
thin measure stick gently place space gum teeth slip gumline
probe slip mm gumline person said gingival pocket migration epithelial attachment occure periodontal pocket apical migration occure
somewhat misnomer depth essence pocket turn define depth ie 2-mm pocket 6-mm pocket
pocket generally accept self-cleansable home person toothbrush mm depth
important pocket deeper mm tooth care sufficient cleanse pocket professional care sought
pocket depth reach mm 028 depth hand instrument ultrasonic scaler use dental professional reach deeply pocket clean microbial plaque cause inflammation
situation bone gum tooth surgically alter alway inflammation likely result bone loss tooth
additional way stop inflammation person receive antibiotics undergo form surgery access depth pocket perhap even change pocket depth become mm depth properly clean person home toothbrush
people 7-mm deeper pocket teeth likely risk eventual tooth loss year
