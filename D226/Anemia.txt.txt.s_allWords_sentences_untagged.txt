blood loss
anemia prematurity frequent blood sample laboratory test combine insufficient rbc production surgery cause acute blood loss gastrointestinal tract lesion cause acute bleed eg variceal lesion peptic ulcer chronic blood loss eg disturbance generally cause chronic blood loss menstruation mostly young women older women fibroid type cancer colorectal cancer cancer urinary bladder cause acute chronic blood loss especially advance stage
infection intestinal nematode feed blood whipworm trichuris
root word anemia ischemia refer basic idea lack blood anemia thing modern medical terminology
word anemia use alone imply widespread effect blood scarce eg blood loss dysfunctional oxygen-supply ability due type hemoglobin erythrocyte problem
contrast word ischemia refer solely lack blood poor perfusion
body part cause localize anemic effect tissue
fluid overload
fluid overload cause decrease concentration apparent anemia
general cause hypervolemia include excessive sodium fluid intake sodium water retention fluid shift intravascular space week pregnancy hormonal change cause increase mother blood volume due increase plasma
intestinal inflammation
certain gastrointestinal disorder cause anemia
mechanism involve multifactorial limit malabsorption mainly relate chronic intestinal inflammation cause dysregulation hepcidin lead decrease access iron circulation
helicobacter pylory infection disorder untreate disease gluten sensitivity anemia manifestation disease absence gastrointestinal symptom bowel disease
diagnosis peripheral blood smear microscopy patient anemia definition
number definition anemia review provide comparison contrast strict broad definition absolute decrease red blood cell mass broader definition lower ability blood carry oxygen operational definition decrease hemoglobin concentration standard deviation mean age- reference range
difficult directly measure mass hematocrit amount rbcs hemoglobin hb blood use instead indirectly estimate value concentration dependent therefore completely accurate
example pregnancy woman mass normal increase blood volume hemoglobin dilute decrease
example bleed rbc mass decrease concentration hemoglobin hematocrit initially remain normal fluid shift area body intravascular space
anemia classify severity mild gl normal moderate gl severe anemia gl adult male adult pregnant female different value use pregnancy children test
anemia typically diagnose complete blood count
