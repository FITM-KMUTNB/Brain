risk factor
expose mode transmission present additional risk factor increase chance contract athlete's foot
person athlete's foot likely become infect
adult likely catch athlete's foot children
men higher chance get athlete's foot women people diabete weaken immune system susceptible disease
hamper immune system increase risk acquire athlete's foot
