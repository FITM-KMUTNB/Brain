symptom iron deficiency unique iron deficiency ie pathognomonic
iron need enzyme function normally wide range symptom eventually emerge secondary result anemia primary result iron deficiency
symptom iron deficiency include
fatigue pallor hair loss twitche irritability weakness brittle groove nail hair thine syndrome painful atrophy mucous membrane cover tongue pharynx esophagus impair immune function restless leg syndrome
continue iron deficiency progress anemia worsen fatigue
elevate platelet count result
lack sufficient iron level blood reason people donate blood
sign symptom children include

rarely bleed respiratory tract inadequate intake see substance diet drug interfer iron absorption antibiotics malabsorption syndrome inflammation adaptive limit bacterial growth infection present chronic disease bowel disease rheumatoid arthritis parasitic infection
genetic defect cause iron deficiency study rodent known genetic disorder human iron metabolism directly cause iron deficiency
possible reason athletics contribute lower iron level include mechanical hemolysis destruction red blood cell physical impact loss iron sweat urine gastrointestinal blood loss haematuria presence blood urine small amount iron excret sweat urine loss generally seen insignificant even increase sweat urine production especially athlete body appear become condition retain iron better mechanical hemolysis likely occur sport especially long distance runner experience hemolysis repeate impact feet ground
gastrointestinal bleed likely occur endurance athlete
haematuria athlete likely occur undergo repetitive impact body particularly affect feet run hard road kendo hand eg
additionally athlete sport emphasize weight loss eg ballet gymnastics marathon run wrestle well sport emphasize low-fat diet increase risk iron deficiency inadequate intake

iron need bacterial growth make bioavailability important factor control infection blood plasma result carry iron tightly bound transferrin taken cell transferrin prevent access bacteria percent protein content human milk consist lactoferrin bind iron

result breast fed baby infection concentrate tear saliva wound bind iron limit bacterial growth
egg white contain conalbumin withhold bacteria get egg shell reason prior antibiotics egg white use treat infection
reduce bacterial growth plasma concentration iron lower variety systemic inflammatory state due increase production hepcidin mainly release liver response increase production pro-inflammatory cytokine

commence treatment definitive diagnosis underly cause iron deficiency
particularly case older patient susceptible colorectal cancer gastrointestinal bleed cause
adult patient anemia underly gastrointestinal disorder lead chronic blood loss likely cause iron deficiency need treatment well
diagnosis condition treate iron supplement
choice supplement depend severity condition require speed improvement eg await elective surgery likelihood treatment effective eg underly ibd undergo dialysis esa therapy
