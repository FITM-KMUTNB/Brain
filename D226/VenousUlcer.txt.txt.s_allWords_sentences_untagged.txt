exact cause venous ulcer certain thought arise venous valve exist prevent blood function properly cause pressure vein increase body need pressure gradient artery vein order heart pump blood forward artery vein
venous hypertension exist artery longer significantly higher pressure vein blood pump effectively area
hypertension stretch vein allow blood protein leak extravascular space isolate extracellular matrix ecm molecule growth factor prevent help heal wound leakage fibrinogen vein well deficiency fibrinolysis cause fibrin build vessel prevent oxygen nutrient reach cell insufficiency cause white blood cell leukocyte accumulate small blood vessel release inflammatory factor reactive oxygen specy ros free radical further contribute chronic wound formation buildup white blood cell small blood vessel plug vessel further contribute ischemia blockage blood vessel leukocyte responsible reflow phenomenon tissue fully allow blood flow back limb example elevate necessary contribute reperfusion injury comorbidity root cause venous ulcer
crus classic venous stasis ulcer occur
stasis result damage vein system lower extremity extreme case allow pressure vein higher pressure artery
