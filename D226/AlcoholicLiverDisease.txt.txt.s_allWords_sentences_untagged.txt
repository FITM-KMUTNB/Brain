alcoholic liver disease term encompass liver manifestation alcohol fatty liver alcoholic hepatitis chronic hepatitis liver fibrosis cirrhosis
major cause liver disease western country
fatty liver develop individual consume large quantity alcoholic beverage long period time process transient reversible heavy drinker develop fatty liver well develop severe alcoholic hepatitis cirrhosis content
risk factor fatty change alcoholic hepatitis diagnosis laboratory find treatment reference further read external link
risk factor
risk factor presently known
quantity alcohol taken consumption 6080g day 14g consider standard drink ie fl oz hard liquor fl oz wine fl oz beer drink six-pack beer daily middle range year men 20gday women significantly increase risk hepatitis fibrosis pattern drink drink outside meal time increase time risk alcoholic liver disease sex women twice susceptible alcohol-relate liver disease develop alcoholic liver disease shorter duration dose chronic consumption
lesser amount alcohol dehydrogenase secret gut higher proportion body fat women change fat absorption due menstrual cycle explain phenomenon hepatitis c infection concomitant hepatitis c infection significantly accelerate process liver injury genetic factor genetic factor predispose alcoholism alcoholic liver disease
monozygotic twin likely alcoholics develop liver cirrhosis dizygotic twin
polymorphism enzyme involve metabolism alcohol aldh mitochondrial dysfunction cytokine polymorphism partly explain genetic component
specific polymorphism currently firmly link alcoholic liver disease
iron overload diet particularly vitamin deficiency worsen liver damage prevent regeneration hepatocyte
particularly concern alcoholics usually malnourish poor diet anorexia encephalopathy
pathogenesis alcohol induce liver injury
mechanism completely understood alcohol pass liver detoxify
chronic consumption alcohol result secretion pro-inflammatory cytokine oxidative stress lipid peroxidation acetaldehyde toxicity
factor cause inflammation apoptosis eventually fibrosis liver cell
occur individual unclear
additionally liver tremendous capacity regenerate even hepatocyte dead continue function normal fatty change main article fatty liver
fatty change accumulation fatty acid liver cell
seen fatty globule microscope
alcoholism cause development large fatty globule macro vesicular steatosis liver begin occur day heavy drink alcohol metabolize alcohol dehydrogenase acetaldehyde further metabolize dehydrogenase acetic acid finally oxidize carbon dioxide co water h process generate increase nadhnad ratio
higher nadh concentration induce fatty acid synthesis decrease nad level result decrease fatty acid oxidation
subsequently higher level fatty acid signal liver cell compound glycerol form triglyceride
triglyceride accumulate result fatty liver
alcoholic hepatitis main article alcoholic hepatitis
alcoholic hepatitis characterize inflammation hepatocyte
heavy drinker develop alcoholic hepatitis
development hepatitis directly relate dose alcohol people seem prone reaction
call alcoholic steato necrosis inflammation appear predispose liver fibrosis
cytokine il6 thought essential initiation perpetuation liver injury induce apoptosis necrosis
possible mechanism increase activity
increase intestinal permeability due liver disease
facilitate absorption gut-produce endotoxin portal circulation
kupffer cell liver endotoxin stimulate release
trigger apoptotic pathway activation caspase result cell death main article
late stage serious liver disease mark inflammation swell fibrosis cellular harden damage membrane prevent detoxification chemical body end scare necrosis cell death
heavy drinker develop cirrhosis liver
responsible fibrosis stimulate collagen deposition hepatic stellate cell production oxidant derive oxi- cytochrome p-450 formation acetaldehyde-protein adduct damage cell membrane symptom include jaundice yellow liver enlargement pain tenderness structural change damage liver architecture
total abstinence alcohol use cirrhosis eventually lead liver failure
late complication cirrhosis liver failure include portal hypertension high blood pressure portal vein due increase flow resistance damage liver coagulation disorder due impair production coagulation factor ascite heavy abdominal swell due buildup fluid tissue complication hepatic encephalopathy hepatorenal syndrome
result cause alcohol abuse viral hepatitis heavy exposure toxin alcohol
late stage cirrhosis look similar medically regardless cause
phenomenon term final common pathway disease
fatty change alcoholic hepatitis abstinence reversible
later stage fibrosis cirrhosis tend irreversible usually contain abstinence long period time
early stage patient exhibit subtle abnormal physical find
usually development advance liver disease stigmata chronic liver disease become apparent
early usually discover routine health examination liver enzyme level found elevate
usually reflect alcoholic hepatic steatosis
steatosis inflammation seen liver biopsy specimen
histologic feature ald indistinguishable fatty liver disease
usually resolve discontinuation alcohol use
continuation alcohol use result higher risk progression liver disease cirrhosis
patient acute alcoholic hepatitis clinical manifestation include fever jaundice possible hepatic decompensation hepatic encephalopathy variceal bleed ascite present abdominal pain unusual
occasionally patient asymptomatic laboratory find
people alcoholic hepatitis serum aspartate aminotransferase ast alanine aminotransferase alt ratio greater
ast alt level alway
elevate ast alt ratio due deficiency phosphate require alt enzyme synthetic pathway
furthermore alcohol injury hepatic mitochondria result ast release
laboratory find include red blood cell mean corpuscular volume elevation serum ggt alkaline phosphatase alk bilirubin level
level reduce alcoholic patient due decrease intestinal absorption increase bone marrow requirement folate presence alcohol increase urinary loss
magnitude white blood cell depletion reflect severity liver injury
feature include mallory body giant mitochondria hepatocyte necrosis neutrophil infiltration area vein
mallory body present liver disease condensation cytokeratin component hepatocyte cytoplasm contribute liver injury
patient moderate severe alcoholic hepatitis cirrhosis identifiable biopsy examination time diagnosis treatment
drink further alcohol important part treatment people chronic hcv infection abstain alcohol intake due risk rapid acceleration liver disease
cochrane review find evidence sufficient use anabolic steroid sometime use recommend severe liver inflammation present
investigate possible treatment ambiguous result review claim benefit methionine disease model
effect necrosis factor medication unclear possibly harmful evidence unclear propylthiouracil result harm
evidence support supplemental nutrition liver disease
rare case liver cirrhosis reversible disease process remain mostly irreversible
liver transplantation remain definitive therapy
today survival liver transplantation similar people ald non-ald
requirement transplant list type liver disease 6-month sobriety prerequisite psychiatric evaluation rehabilitation assistance ie alcoholics anonymous

even drink g daily suffer serious alcohol-relate liver injury
nevertheless alcohol-relate mortality lead cause death united states
