cardiovascular disease preventable establish risk factor avoid medical management atherosclerosis involve modification risk example smoke cessation diet restriction
prevention generally eate healthy diet exercise smoke maintain normal weight diet
change diet help prevent development atherosclerosis
evidence suggest diet contain dairy product effect decrease risk cardiovascular disease
diet high fruit vegetable decrease risk cardiovascular disease death evidence suggest mediterranean diet improve cardiovascular result evidence mediterranean diet better low-fat diet bring long-term change cardiovascular risk factor eg lower cholesterol level blood pressure exercise
control exercise program combat atherosclerosis improve circulation functionality vessel
exercise use manage weight patient obese lower blood pressure decrease cholesterol
lifestyle modification combine medication therapy
example help lower cholesterol medication aspirin help prevent clot variety antihypertensive medication routinely use control blood pressure
combine effort risk factor modification medication therapy sufficient control symptom fight imminent threat ischemic event physician resort interventional surgical procedure correct obstruction treatment
treatment establish disease include medication lower cholesterol blood pressure medication medication decrease clote aspirin number procedure carry percutaneous coronary intervention coronary artery bypass graft carotid endarterectomy
