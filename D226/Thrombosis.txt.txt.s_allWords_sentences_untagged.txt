thrombosis ancient greek
sis clote formation blood clot blood vessel obstruct flow blood circulatory system
blood vessel vein artery injure body use platelet fibrin form blood clot prevent blood loss
even blood vessel injure blood clot form body certain condition
clot piece clot break free begin travel body known embolus
thrombosis occur vein venous thrombosis artery arterial thrombosis
thrombosis lead congestion affect part body arterial thrombosis rarely severe venous thrombosis affect blood supply lead damage tissue supply artery necrosis
piece arterial venous thrombus break embolus travel circulation lodge somewhere else embolism
type embolism known thromboembolism
complication arise venous thromboembolism commonly call vte lodge lung pulmonary embolism
arterial embolus travel further affect blood vessel lodge embolism

cause example genetic deficiency autoimmune disorder
recent study indicate white blood cell play pivotal role deep vein thrombosis mediate numerous pro-thrombotic action cell injury
inflammatory process trauma surgery infection cause damage endothelial line vessel wall
main mechanism exposure tissue factor blood coagulation system stimuly lead change gene expression endothelium produce pro-thrombotic state occur endothelial cell substance key modulator thrombin activity end result sustain activation thrombin reduce production protein tissue factor inhibitor further pro-thrombotic state
injury invariably involve formation thromby artery high rate blood flow normally hinder clot formation
addition arterial cardiac clot normally rich plateletswhich require clot formation area high stress due blood flow disturb blood flow further information blood flow
cause disturb blood flow include stagnation blood flow point injury venous stasis occur heart failure long period sedentary behaviour sit long airplane flight

occlusive thrombus define thrombosis small vessel lead complete occlusion wound heal reorganise occlusive thrombus scar tissue scar tissue permanently obstruct vessel contract activity unblock lumen
mural thrombus define thrombus large vessel restrict blood flow occlude completely histological reorganisation thrombus occur classic wound heal mechanism
