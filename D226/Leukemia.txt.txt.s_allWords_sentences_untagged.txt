pathologically leukemia subdivide variety large group
division acute chronic form
acute leukemia characterize rapid increase number immature blood cell
crowd result cell make bone marrow unable produce healthy blood cell
immediate treatment require acute leukemia rapid progression accumulation malignant cell spill bloodstream spread organ body
acute form leukemia common form leukemia children
chronic leukemia characterize excessive buildup relatively mature abnormal white blood cell
typically take month year progress cell produce higher rate normal result abnormal white blood cell
acute leukemia treate immediately chronic form sometime monitor time treatment ensure maximum effectiveness therapy
chronic leukemia mostly occur older people occur age group
additionally disease subdivide kind blood cell affect
divide leukemia lymphoblastic lymphocytic leukemia myeloid myelogenous leukemia
lymphoblastic lymphocytic leukemia cancerous change take place type marrow cell normally goe form lymphocyte infection-fight immune system cell

large granular lymphocytic leukemia involve cell hairy cell leukemia involve solely cell rare indolent aggressive leukemia adult t-cell leukemia cause human t-lymphotropic virus virus similar hiv
hiv htlv infect replicate hiv destroy

human t-cell virus type htlv-iiy endemic certain area world
eosinophilia call clonal hypereosinophilia group blood disorder characterize growth eosinophil bone marrow blood tissue
pre-cancerous cancerous
involve clone eosinophil ie group genetically identical eosinophil grew mutate ancestor cell disorder evolve chronic eosinophilic leukemia associate various form neoplasm lymphoid neoplasm myelodysplastic syndrome
transient myeloproliferative disease term transient leukemia involve abnormal proliferation clone megakaryoblast
disease restrict individual syndrome genetic change similar syndrome develop baby pregnancy shortly birth resolve month case progress acute megakaryoblastic leukemia
transient myeloid leukemia pre-leukemic condition
sign symptom common symptom chronic acute leukemia
common symptom children easy bruise pale skin fever enlarge spleen liver
damage bone marrow way displace normal bone marrow cell higher number immature white blood cell result lack blood platelet important blood clote process
mean people leukemia easily become bruise bleed excessively develop pinprick bleed
white blood cell involve fight pathogen suppress dysfunctional
cause person immune system unable fight simple infection start attack body cell
leukemia prevent immune system work normally people experience frequent infection rang infect tonsil sore mouth diarrhea life-threaten pneumonia opportunistic infection
finally red blood cell deficiency lead anemia cause pallor
people experience symptom feel sick fever chill night sweat feel fatigue flu-like symptom
people experience nausea feel fullness due enlarge liver spleen result unintentional weight loss
affect disease come together become swollen liver lymph node cause pain lead nausea
leukemic cell invade central nervous system neurological symptom notably headache occur
neurological symptom migraine seizure coma occur result brain stem pressure
symptom associate leukemia attribute disease
consequently leukemia alway diagnose medical test
word leukemia mean white blood derive characteristic high white blood cell count present afflict people treatment
high number white blood cell apparent blood sample view microscope extra white blood cell frequently immature dysfunctional
excessive number cell interfere level cell cause further harmful imbalance blood count
people diagnose leukemia high white blood cell count visible regular blood count
less-common condition call leukemia
bone marrow contain cancerous white blood cell disrupt normal production blood cell remain marrow instead enter bloodstream visible blood test
person leukemia white blood cell count bloodstream normal low
leukemia occur major type leukemia particularly common hairy cell leukemia cause
single known cause different type leukemia
known cause generally factor control average person account relatively case cause case leukemia unknown
different leukemia likely different cause
leukemia cancer result mutation dna
certain mutation trigger leukemia activate oncogene tumor suppressor gene thereby disrupt regulation cell death differentiation division
mutation occur spontaneously result exposure radiation carcinogenic substance
adult known cause natural artificial ionize radiation viruse human t-lymphotropic virus chemical notably benzene chemotherapy agent previous malignancy use tobacco associate small increase risk develop acute myeloid leukemia adult cohort case-control study link exposure petrochemical hair dye development form leukemia
diet limit effect eate vegetable confer small protective benefit
viruse link form leukemia
