sign symptom
symptom vary person person
early stage kidney disease feel sick notice symptom occur
kidney fail filter properly waste accumulate blood body condition call
low level azotaemia produce symptom
disease progress symptom become noticeable failure sufficient degree cause symptom
kidney failure accompany noticeable symptom term
symptom kidney failure include follow
high level urea blood result vomit diarrhea lead dehydration nausea weight loss urination frequent urination greater amount usual pale urine frequent urination smaller amount usual dark colour urine blood urine pressure difficulty urinate unusual amount urination usually large quantity buildup phosphate blood disease kidney filter cause bone damage broken bone muscle cramp cause low level calcium associate hyperphosphatemia buildup potassium blood disease kidney filter call hyperkalemia cause abnormal heart rhythm muscle paralysis failure kidney remove excess fluid cause hand leg ankle feet face shortness breath due extra fluid lung cause polycystic kidney disease cause large fluid-fil cyst kidney sometime liver cause pain back side healthy kidney produce hormone stimulate bone marrow make red blood cell
kidney fail produce erythropoietin result decrease production red blood cell replace natural breakdown old red blood cell

cause symptom extensive kidney damage occure symptom include foamy bubbly urine hand feet abdomen face symptom include loss include bad taste mouth difficulty sleep darken skin excess protein blood high dose penicillin people kidney failure experience seizure
cause acute kidney injury
acute kidney injury previously known acute kidney failure aky usually occur blood supply kidney suddenly interrupt kidney become overload toxin
cause acute kidney injury include accident injury complication surgery kidney deprive normal blood flow extend period time
surgery example procedure
drug overdose accidental chemical overload drug antibiotics chemotherapy cause onset acute kidney injury
chronic kidney disease kidney recover acute kidney injury allow person aki resume normal life
people suffer acute kidney injury require supportive treatment kidney recover function remain increase risk develop future kidney failure
accidental cause kidney failure crush syndrome large amount toxin suddenly release blood circulation long compress limb suddenly relieve pressure obstruct blood flow tissue cause
result overload lead clog destruction kidney
reperfusion injury appear release crush pressure
mechanism believe release bloodstream muscle breakdown product notably potassium phosphorus product rhabdomyolysis breakdown skeletal muscle damage ischemic condition
specific action kidney fully understood due part nephrotoxic metabolite
chronic kidney failure
chronic kidney failure numerous cause
common cause chronic failure diabete mellitus long-term uncontrol hypertension kidney disease well-known cause chronic failure
majority people afflict kidney disease family history disease
genetic illness cause kidney failure well
overuse common drug paracetamol cause chronic kidney failure
infectious disease agent attack kidney cause kidney failure genetic predisposition
apol1 gene propose major genetic risk locus spectrum kidney failure individual african origin include nephropathy primary nonmonogenic form focal segmental glomerulosclerosis hypertension affiliate chronic kidney disease attribute etiology western african variant apol1 show associate end stage kidney disease african american hispanic american diagnostic approach measurement
stage kidney failure
chronic kidney failure measure stage calculate use person glomerular filtration rate
stage mildly diminish renal function overt symptom
stage need increase level supportive care medical provider slow treat renal dysfunction
people stage kidney failure usually require preparation active treatment order survive
stage consider severe illness require form renal replacement therapy dialysis kidney transplant whenever feasible
filtration rate
normal gfr vary factor sex age body size ethnic background
renal professional consider glomerular filtration rate best overal index kidney function national kidney foundation offer easy use on-line gfr calculator interest know glomerular filtration rate
serum creatinine level simple blood test need use calculator

term contamination blood urea
presence excessive amount urea blood
start include reduce urine output thought cause urine mix blood instead void urethra

treatment acute kidney injury depend cause treatment chronic kidney failure include renal replacement therapy peritoneal dialysis kidney transplant diet
non-diabetics people type diabete low protein diet found preventative effect progression chronic kidney disease
effect apply people type diabete whole food diet help people kidney disease high protein diet animal plant source appear negative effect kidney function short term slow progression
people receive earlier referral nephrology specialist mean longer time start dialysis shorter initial hospitalization reduce risk death start dialysis method reduce disease progression include minimize exposure nephrotoxin nsaids intravenous contrast
