septic shock potentially fatal medical condition occur sepsis organ injury damage response infection lead dangerously low blood pressure abnormality cellular metabolism
international consensus definition sepsis septic shock sepsis-3 define septic shock subset sepsis particularly profound circulatory cellular metabolic abnormality associate greater risk mortality sepsis alone

pathophysiology septic shock entirely understood known key role development severe sepsis play immune coagulation response infection
anti-inflammatory response play role septic shock septic shock involve widespread inflammatory response produce hypermetabolic effect

septic shock diagnose low blood pressure bp respond treatment

diagnosis septic shock made systolic blood pressure mean arterial pressure map mm systolic bp decrease mm cause low bp definition
septic shock subclass distributive shock condition abnormal distribution blood flow smallest blood vessel result inadequate blood supply body tissue result ischemia organ dysfunction
septic shock refer specifically distributive shock due sepsis result infection
septic shock define low blood pressure persist treatment intravenous fluid low blood pressure reduce tissue perfusion pressure cause tissue hypoxia characteristic shock
release large scale inflammatory response result massive increase capillary permeability decrease systemic vascular resistance low blood pressure
finally attempt offset decrease blood pressure ventricular dilatation myocardial dysfunction occur
septic shock regard stage systemic inflammatory response syndrome sepsis severe sepsis multiple organ dysfunction syndrome represent different stage pathophysiological process
organism cope infection lead systemic response sepsis further progress severe sepsis septic shock organ failure eventually result death
treatment primarily consist follow
give intravenous fluid early antibiotic administration early goal direct therapy rapid source identification control support major organ dysfunction
lower blood pressure septic shock contribute poor perfusion fluid resuscitation initial treatment increase blood volume
patient demonstrate hypoperfusion initially resuscitate mlkg intravenous crystalloid hourscrystalloid normal saline lactate ringer solution recommend initial fluid choice use colloid solution starch show advantage decrease mortality
large quantity fluid give administer albumin show benefit antibiotics
treatment guideline call administration broad-spectrum antibiotics hour follow recognition septic shock
prompt antimicrobial therapy important risk dy increase approximately hour delay receive antibiotics time constraint allow culture identification test antibiotic sensitivity specific microorganism responsible infection
therefore combination antimicrobial therapy cover wide range potential causative organism ty better outcome antibiotics continue day patient treatment duration shorter longer depend clinical response
choice norepinephrine superior dopamine septic shock norepinephrine prefer vasopressor epinephrine ad norepinephrine need
vasopressin use addition norepinephrine recommend first-line treatment
cause rapid heart rate arrhythmia recommend combination norepinephrine slow heart rate low risk arrhythmia
