stomach pain usually signal peptic ulcer disease
case doctor treat ulcer diagnose specific test observe symptom resolve indicate primary diagnosis accurate
specifically peptic ulcer disease erode muscularis mucosae minimum reach level submucosa contrast erosion involve muscularis mucosae

gold standard diagnosis peptic ulcer disease direct visual identification location severity ulcer describe
moreover ulcer present provide alternative diagnosis
