additional symptom include fatigue fever weight loss unexplain bone fracture
patient experience symptom painless mass

past decade ct guide ablation emerge invasive alternative surgical resection care benign bone tumor notably osteoid
technique perform conscious sedation rf probe introduce tumor cannulate needle ct guidance heat apply locally destroy tumor cell
procedure introduce treatment osteoma early show numerous study invasive expensive result bone destruction equivalent safety efficacy surgical technique patient report freedom symptom initial success rate rfa high symptom recurrence rfa treatment report study demonstrate recurrence rate similar surgical treatment
thermal ablation technique increasingly use palliative treatment painful metastatic bone disease
currently external beam radiation therapy standard care patient localize bone pain due metastatic disease
majority patient experience complete partial relief pain radiation therapy effect immediate show study transient patient patient eligible respond traditional therapy ie radiation therapy chemotherapy palliative surgery analgesic medication thermal ablation technique explor alternative pain reduction
clinical trial study efficacy rfa treatment moderate severe pain patient metastatic bone disease show significant decrease patient report pain treatment study limit patient metastatic site pain multiple tumor difficult localize direct therapy
recently explor potentially effective alternative area destruction create technique monitor effectively ct rfa potential advantage treate adjacent critical structure
outlook depend type tumor
outcome expect good people benign tumor type benign tumor eventually become cancerous malignant
malignant bone tumor spread patient achieve cure cure rate depend type cancer location size factor
