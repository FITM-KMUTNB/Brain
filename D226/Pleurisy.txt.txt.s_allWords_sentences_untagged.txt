sign symptom
define symptom pleurisy sudden sharp stab burn dull pain right left side chest breath especially inhale exhale feel worse deep breath cough sneez laugh
pain stay place spread shoulder back sometime become fairly constant dull ache
cause pleurisy accompany symptom
dry cough fever chill rapid shallow breath shortness breath fast heart rate sore throat follow pain swell joint
relate problem
pleurisy associate complication affect pleural space
case pleurisy excess fluid build pleural space
call pleural effusion
buildup excess fluid force layer pleura apart dont rub breath
relieve pain pleurisy
large amount fluid result collapse lung
make difficult breathe
case pleural effusion excess fluid become infect turn abscess
call empyema
effusion involve exudate fluid call pleurisy sometime occur later stage pleurisy
person develop pleural effusion absence pleurisy
example pneumonia heart failure cancer pulmonary embolism lead pleural effusion
air ga build pleural space
call pneumothorax
result acute lung injury lung disease emphysema
lung procedure surgery drainage fluid needle examination lung light camera mechanical ventilation cause pneumothorax
common symptom sudden pain side lung shortness breath
pneumothorax put pressure lung cause collapse
pneumothorax small go
large chest tube place skin chest wall pleural space remove air
blood collect pleural space
common cause injury chest blunt force surgery heart chest
occur people lung pleural cancer
put pressure lung force collapse
cause shock state hypoperfusion insufficient amount blood able reach organ
cause pleurisy line space mark blue
pleural space invade fluid air particle part body fairly complicate diagnosis viral infection b virus adenovirus influenza common cause pleurisy
different condition cause pleurisy
dissection disorder systemic lupus drug-induce lupus hepatitis rheumatoid arthritis disease
bacterial infection associate pneumonia tuberculosis chest injury blunt penetrate mediterranean fever inherit condition cause fever swell abdomen lung parasitic infection heart surgery especially bypass graft cardiac problem inflammatory bowel disease lung cancer lymphoma lung disease cystic fibrosis sarcoidosis asbestosis pulmonary embolism blood clot enter lung
space pleurae start fill fluid pleural effusion chest pain ease shortness breath result lung need room expand breath
case pleurisy idiopathic mean exact cause determine
diagnosis pleurisy pleural condition base medical history physical examination diagnostic test goal rule source symptom find cause pleurisy underly disorder treate
physical examination
doctor use stethoscope listen breath
method detect unusual sound lung
person pleurisy inflam layer pleurae make rough scratchy sound rub breath
call pleural friction rub
diagnostic test
result physical examination diagnostic test sometime perform
chest x-ray
chest x-ray take picture heart lung
show air fluid pleural space
show cause eg pneumonia fracture rib lung tumor pleurisy
sometime x-ray taken ly painful side
show fluid well change fluid position appear vertical x-ray
blood test
blood test detect bacterial viral infection pneumonia rheumatic fever pulmonary embolism lupus
test determine heart condition contribute symptom
use sound wave create image
show fluid locate chest
show tumor
ultrasound detect fluid lung known pleural effusion sound wave scatter air
therefore actual picture lung obtain ultrasonography
compute tomography ct scan
ct scan provide computer-generate picture lung show pocket fluid
show sign pneumonia lung abscess tumor
magnetic resonance image mry
magnetic resonance image mry call nuclear magnetic resonance nmr scan use powerful magnet show pleural effusion tumor
arterial blood ga
arterial blood-ga sample small amount blood taken artery usually wrist
blood check oxygen carbon-dioxide level
test show well lung take oxygen
thoracentesis illustration show person undergo
person sit upright lean table
excess fluid pleural space drain bag
presence excess fluid pleural cavity pleural effusion suspect location fluid confirm sample fluid remove test procedure remove fluid chest call diagnostic thoracentesis doctor insert small needle thin hollow plastic tube chest wall withdraw fluid
doctor office hospital
ultrasound use guide needle fluid trap small pocket lung
usually cause serious complication
generally chest x-ray procedure evaluate lung
possible complication thoracentesis include follow
bleed bruise needle went
rare case bleed occur lung
doctor use chest tube drain blood
case surgery need
infection needle went injury liver spleen rare case pain
buildup air pleural space collapse partially collapse lung
sometime air come needle needle make hole lung
usually hole seal sometime air build lung make collapse
chest tube remove air let lung expand
lung fluid examine microscope evaluate presence chemical color texture
degree clarity indicator infection cancer condition cause buildup fluid blood pleural space
tuberculosis cancer suspect small piece pleura examine microscope make definitive diagnosis
call biopsy
approache take tissue sample available
insertion needle skin chest remove small sample outer layer pleura insertion small tube light end endoscope tiny cut chest wall visualize pleura biopsy small piece tissue endoscope removal sample pleura small cut chest wall open pleural biopsy usually sample needle biopsy small accurate diagnosis
treatment goal
relief symptom removal fluid air blood pleural space treatment underly condition
large amount fluid air blood remove pleural space cause lung collapse
surgical procedure use drain fluid air blood pleural space follow
needle thin hollow plastic tube insert rib back chest chest wall
syringe attach draw fluid chest
procedure remove cup litre fluid time
larger amount fluid remove chest tube insert chest wall
doctor inject local painkiller area chest wall fluid
plastic tube insert chest rib
tube connect box suction fluid
chest x-ray taken check tube position
chest tube use drain blood air pleural space
take day
tube left place patient usually stay hospital time
sometime fluid contain thick pus blood clot form hard skin peel
make harder drain fluid
help break pus blood clot doctor use chest tube put certain medicine pleural space
medicine call
pus blood clot drain surgery necessary
couple medication use relieve pleurisy symptom
acetaminophen anti-inflammatory agent control pain decrease inflammation
indomethacin brand name study respect relief pleurisy codeine-base cough control cough
role use corticosteroid pleurisy tacrolimus trexal rheumatrex treatment pleurisy
further study need
lifestyle change
follow helpful management pleurisy
ly painful side comfortable breath deeply cough clear mucus pain ease
otherwise pneumonia develop
get rest
treate cause
ideally treatment pleurisy aim eliminate underly cause disease
pleural fluid infect treatment involve antibiotics drain fluid
infection tuberculosis fungus treatment involve long-term use antibiotics antifungal medicine
fluid cause tumor pleura build quickly drain
sometime medicine prevent further fluid buildup
dont doctor seal pleural space
involve drainage fluid chest chest tube
substance insert chest tube pleural space
substance irritate surface pleura
cause layer pleurae squeeze shut room fluid build
radiation treatment use reduce size tumor
congestive heart failure cause fluid buildup treatment usually include diuretics medicine
treatment pleurisy depend origin prescribe physician base individual assessment paracetamol amoxicillin antibiotics case bacterial infection common remedy dispense doctor relieve initial symptom pain chest viral infection self-limit
anti-inflammatory drug nsaids preferably usually employ pain control agent alternative treatment
number alternative complementary medicine investigate anti-inflammatory property use pleurisy
time clinical trial compound perform
extract brazilian folk remedy show reduce inflammation pleural cavity mice extract thought inhibit enzyme cox-2 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug pleurisy disorder pleurae serious cause
generally pleurisy treatment excellent prognosis left untreate cause severe complication
example result pulmonary heart disease manifest inflammation arm leg lead heart failure
condition cause pleurisy pleural disorder adequately diagnose treate early expect full recovery
