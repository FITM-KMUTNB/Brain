aphasia best thought collection different disorder single problem
individual aphasia present particular combination language strength weakness
consequently major challenge document various difficulty occur different people let alone decide best treate
classification aphasia tend divide various symptom broad class
common approach distinguish fluent aphasia speech remain fluent content lack person difficulty understand nonfluent aphasia speech halt effortful consist word time
broad-base group proven fully adequate

individual aphasia refer receptive fluent aphasia speak long sentence mean add unnecessary word even create new word
example receptive aphasia say delicious taco mean dog need go take walk
poor auditory read comprehension fluent nonsensical oral written expression
individual receptive aphasia usually great difficulty understand speech therefore unaware mistake
language deficit usually arise lesion posterior portion left hemisphere area result trauma temporal region brain specifically damage area trauma result array problem commonly seen result stroke individual aphasia frequently speak short meaningful phrase produce great effort
characterize nonfluent aphasia
affect people omit small word
example person expressive aphasia say walk dog mean take dog walk take dog walk even dog walk yard
individual expressive aphasia able understand speech vary degree
aware difficulty become easily frustrate speak problem aphasia appear solely issue language production evidence suggest aphasia root inability process syntactical information individual aphasia speech call recure recurrent utterance
speech repeate lexical speech eg cant cant number non-lexical utterance made repeate legal meaningless consonant-vowel syllable eg tan tan
severe case individual able utter speech time attempt speech

approache aim classify aphasia major present characteristics region brain probably gave rise inspire early work nineteenth-century neurologist paul broca carl approache identify major subtype aphasia minor subtype
aphasia known motor aphasia aphasia characterize halt fragment effortful speech well-preserve comprehension relative expression
damage typically anterior portion left hemisphere notably broca area
individual aphasia weakness paralysis arm leg left frontal lobe important body movement particularly right side
aphasia known sensory aphasia wernicke aphasia characterize fluent speech mark difficulty understand word sentence
fluent speech lack key substantive word noun verb adjective contain incorrect word even nonsense word
subtype associate damage posterior left temporal cortex notably wernicke area
individual usually body weakness brain injury part brain control movement
conduction aphasia speech remain fluent comprehension preserve person disproportionate difficulty repeate word sentence
damage typically involve arcuate left parietal region motor aphasia sensory aphasia similar broca wernicke aphasia respectively ability repeat word sentence disproportionately preserve
recent classification scheme adopt approach boston-neoclassical model group classical aphasia subtype larger class nonfluent aphasia encompass aphasia motor aphasia fluent aphasia encompass aphasia conduction aphasia sensory aphasia

localizationist approache recognize existence additional pure form language disorder affect single language skill example pure alexia person able write read pure word deafness able produce speech read understand speech spoken
cognitive neuropsychological approache
approache provide useful way classify different pattern language difficulty broad group problem sizeable number individual fit neatly category problem category particularly major aphasia remain quite broad
consequently even individual meet criteria classification subtype enormous variability type difficulty experience
instead categorize individual specific subtype cognitive neuropsychological approache aim identify key language skill module function properly individual
person potentially difficulty module number module
type approach require framework theory need perform different kind language task
example model max coltheart identify module recognize phoneme spoken essential task involve recognition word
similarly module store phoneme person plan produce speech module critical task involve production long word long string speech
theoretical framework establish function module assess use specific test set test
